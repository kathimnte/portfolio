## Projects

### Response Evaluation in RAG Models with RAGAS
Developed an automated pipeline to evaluate the accuracy of responses from RAG models using RAGAS. Key metrics such as context_precision, context_recall, faithfulness, and answer_relevancy were implemented to ensure reliable and relevant responses.

### Customer Service Bot Optimization
Refined prompting and improved information retrieval performance in customer service bots based on Azure Search. Implemented mechanisms to prevent inappropriate responses and ensure proper interpretation of sensitive queries.
